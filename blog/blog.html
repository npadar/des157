        Blog 3: Studio 3 Evaluation </h2>

        <p>
          When the user hovers over a keychian, the image will increase in size a little bit
          to give the user a hint that something will happen when the image is clicked on.
          When a keychain is clicked on, a text bubble will appear to the side of it explaining
          a story about the keychain and where I got it.

        Blog 2: Form Evaluation </h2>

        <p>
           A form that I use often is Nordstrom's checkout form. It includes input boxes
           for your Name, Address, City, ZIP code, and Phone. There is a drop down menu to
           select the state, and a radio button to select whether or not you want this same
           address to be used as the billing address.
        </p>

        <p>
          Priority: If you forget to input into a field a red notification with an exclamation point will
          appear above the field. This uses <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/billder/learning-ixd-from-everyday-objects">
          Bill DeTouchey's</a> principle on how green means good
          and red means bad. The form also uses zoning to separate out content. Below the billing
          address is a section for shipping method, followed by payment, and ending with
          a review of the order. Each of these zones are unaccessbile until the previous zone is
          completely filled out. Each zone also gets a light gray background when selected to make it easier
          on the user to separate the content from the background.
        </p>

        <p>
          Clarity: The interface of the form communicates clearly. Every input box has a clear
          label including helpful hints on what should go in the box in case there is the slightest of
          confusion. For example for the Address 2 box, there are keywords such as Compant, C/O, Apt, Suite,
          etc. to help the user just in case they get confused on why there are two address boxes. There
          are also little icons with "?"'s in which the user can click on receive more details on what or why
          they need to input into the form.
        </p>

        <p>
          Purpose: The web form has a clear purpose which is to get all the necessary information from the
          user in order to send them the item they bought.

        Blog 1: User Interface Evaluation </h2>
        <p> An user interface that I often use is the Google Calendar mobile application.
          I find this application extremely useful in keeping my class, work and
          extracurricular activities schedules. The interface is easy to learn and use.
          When first opening the calendar, I am directed straight to my schedule so I can
          see what activities I have going on during the day. I can pick the color of the
          activity when I input them into the calendar which makes it easy for me to
          organize the types of events, ie. green for work, light blue for class, dark blue
          for meetings, etc. I can also click on the month to get a drop schedule of the month.
        </p>

        <img src="images/blog1-4.PNG" class="picture" alt="picture">

        <p> By clicking on the menu bar at the top left corner, I can easily choose which format
          I would like to view my schedule in. I can then click the big, red button on the bottom
          left corner to add something to my schedule. Three options appear and I can choose whichever
          I would like to add. The menu and add icon is an effective user interface design because it
          is straightforward and a new user can easily navigate through it.
        </p>

        <img src="images/blog1-2.PNG" class="picture" alt="picture">

        <p> The schedule input menu is also well-designed because it has every option a user would need
          to keep track of their schedule. Name of the event can be inputted right away at the top of the
          screen, along with choosing which calendar the event belongs to. You can set a recurring event
          easily by using the "Custom Repeat" option. I find this element extremely useful because most
          activities that I have going on are on a quarterly basis. To be able to set my schedule and repeat
          certain items until a specific date is very useful and efficient. You can also easily turn any
          calendar on or off by unchecking the boxes next to it.
        </p>

        <p> On top of keeping track of everything for me, this application is well-designed. The colors I can choose from are visually appealing and everything is clearly marked. Google calendar also has the option of sharing your calendar with others so that you may view their schedule as well. This is convenient when trying to schedule meet-ups with friends or family. This application has helps me keep track of where I need to be, thus improving my lifestyle tremendously. </p>
