        Blog 5: Studio 5 Evaluation </h2>

        <p>
          For my studio 5, I started out with researching the best Javascript libraries to use for
          making interactive maps. I decided to use the <a href="https://www.mapbox.com">Mapbox</a>
          library. At first, I was really confused and overwhelmed on how to use this library but
          as I looked into it more, it started to make more sense.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started out with creating my own dataset of endangered species which included their name,
          conservation status, picture, and description. I plan on adding more information to each animal
          including a section on how to help and videos. I then added coordinates to each species to specify
          where on the planet they are found. Once I figure out how to, I plan on actually changing the point
          to areas where the species is found. This would give a more accurate representation of the regions
          the species are found.
        </p>

        <p>
          I wanted to make the map interactive which was confusing to figure out because there were so
          many different ways of doing it, it was hard to pick out the best one. I ended up using the Mapbox
          popup feature which is able to set the html of the features you want to show up when the user
          clicks on a dot. I then realized that using the "single point" option would not work with the
          plans I had in mind. Instead, I should use a "symbol" so I am able to customize each dot based
          on the different status of each species.
        </p>

        <p>
          This library is a good way to make interactive maps although it takes time to figure out how
          everything works. I do think it was an easier alternative to other libraries such as d3
          which are far more complicated since it has many more features. I would recommend Mapbox
          to someone who is looking to make interactive maps. A lot of the "styling" of the map
          is done through the Mapbox studio editor which makes is easier on the developer since
          the code is automatically written for them. All they have to do is link their customized
          map in the Javascript and code a few lines for the map to become interactive.

        Blog 4: Studio 4 Evaluation </h2>

        <p>
          My studio 4 is based off the process of developing pictures in the darkroom. There
          are four different trays of solutions you need to put your image in to develop. The first
          is the developer, then stop, then fixer, and finally a water rinse.
        </p>

        <p>
          Underneath the title of the page, I put a line that tells the user how to start interacting
          with the page. When the user hovers over the film, a tool tip will appear and guide the user
          into what the next step is. The tool tips are connected to the individual timers because
          I figured that as the user is waiting for the time to stop, they could already know what
          the next step they should do is. After clicking on the image of the timer, a countdown will
          appear underneath each tray so the user knows how much more time is left for that step in
          the development. This mimicks the real process of developing a picture in the darkroom.
          After time is up, an image will appear, and each step the image will get stronger in opacity.
          This also mimicks what it looks like when developing in real life. The final step is clicking
          on the fully developed picture to see an englarged version on the side. This is just so the user
          has a better sense of what the picture looks like and the cool "process" they just went through.
        </p>

        <p>
          One aspect of my design that I thought was interesting was how I added in a subtle hover
          effect on the timers. When the user is hovering over it, the timer will vibrate slightly
          to show that the timer has some interactive element to it. I also liked how at each
          step the image gradually shows up. This really represents how it looks like when you actually
          do it. Another thing I liked was that the user is able to click on the final image to see what
          it actually looks like. I did this because the image is a bit small while in the development
          process, and I wanted the user to be able to fully experience how it felt like to be in a darkroom.

        Blog 3: Studio 3 Evaluation </h2>

        <p>
          I made my studio 3 based off of the numerous keychains I have collected throughout
          my travels. These are just a few to showcase the diverse places I have visited! Traveling
          is one of my favorite things to do and these keychains helps me remember all the
          fun times I've had.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the user hovers over a keychain, the image will increase in size a little bit
          to give the user a hint that something will happen when the image is clicked on.
          When a keychain is clicked on, a text bubble will appear to the side of it explaining
          a story about the keychain and where I got it. I also put in a fade-in effect so when
          the page loads, the images slowy go from opacity:0 to opacity:1. I feel that this effect
          is nice to have so not all the content pops out at the user at once. The hair also
          sways back and forth when the mouse is hovered over it. I did this since the hair has
          such a large surface area on the page so that the user will realize that the items
          can move. This can then lead them to further exploration of the page.

        Blog 2: Form Evaluation </h2>

        <p>
           A form that I use often is Nordstrom's checkout form. It includes input boxes
           for your Name, Address, City, ZIP code, and Phone. There is a drop down menu to
           select the state, and a radio button to select whether or not you want this same
           address to be used as the billing address.
        </p>

        <p>
          Priority: If you forget to input into a field a red notification with an exclamation point will
          appear above the field. This uses <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/billder/learning-ixd-from-everyday-objects">
          Bill DeTouchey's</a> principle on how green means good
          and red means bad. The form also uses zoning to separate out content. Below the billing
          address is a section for shipping method, followed by payment, and ending with
          a review of the order. Each of these zones are unaccessbile until the previous zone is
          completely filled out. Each zone also gets a light gray background when selected to make it easier
          on the user to separate the content from the background.
        </p>

        <p>
          Clarity: The interface of the form communicates clearly. Every input box has a clear
          label including helpful hints on what should go in the box in case there is the slightest of
          confusion. For example for the Address 2 box, there are keywords such as Company, C/O, Apt, Suite,
          etc. to help the user just in case they get confused on why there are two address boxes. There
          are also little icons with "?"'s in which the user can click on receive more details on what or why
          they need to input into the form.
        </p>

        <p>
          Purpose: The web form has a clear purpose which is to get all the necessary information from the
          user in order to send them the item they bought.

        Blog 1: User Interface Evaluation </h2>
        <p> An user interface that I often use is the Google Calendar mobile application.
          I find this application extremely useful in keeping my class, work and
          extracurricular activities schedules. The interface is easy to learn and use.
          When first opening the calendar, I am directed straight to my schedule so I can
          see what activities I have going on during the day. I can pick the color of the
          activity when I input them into the calendar which makes it easy for me to
          organize the types of events, ie. green for work, light blue for class, dark blue
          for meetings, etc. I can also click on the month to get a drop schedule of the month.
        </p>

        <img src="images/blog1-1.PNG" class="picture" alt="picture">
        <img src="images/blog1-4.PNG" class="picture" alt="picture">

        <p> By clicking on the menu bar at the top left corner, I can easily choose which format
          I would like to view my schedule in. I can then click the big, red button on the bottom
          left corner to add something to my schedule. Three options appear and I can choose whichever
          I would like to add. The menu and add icon is an effective user interface design because it
          is straightforward and a new user can easily navigate through it.
        </p>

        <img src="images/blog1-2.PNG" class="picture" alt="picture">

        <p> The schedule input menu is also well-designed because it has every option a user would need
          to keep track of their schedule. Name of the event can be inputted right away at the top of the
          screen, along with choosing which calendar the event belongs to. You can set a recurring event
          easily by using the "Custom Repeat" option. I find this element extremely useful because most
          activities that I have going on are on a quarterly basis. To be able to set my schedule and repeat
          certain items until a specific date is very useful and efficient. You can also easily turn any
          calendar on or off by unchecking the boxes next to it.
        </p>

        <p> On top of keeping track of everything for me, this application is well-designed. The colors I can choose from are visually appealing and everything is clearly marked. Google calendar also has the option of sharing your calendar with others so that you may view their schedule as well. This is convenient when trying to schedule meet-ups with friends or family. This application has helps me keep track of where I need to be, thus improving my lifestyle tremendously. </p>
