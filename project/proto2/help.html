      ADOPT A SEA TURTLE!
      <br />
      Having traveled the seas for over 100 million years, sea turtles have outlived almost all of the
      prehistoric animals with which they once shared the planet. Having survived the extinction of the
      dinosaurs, marine turtles still inhabit the oceansâ€™ open waters and coastal habitats, feeding on
      jellyfish and other aquatic plants and animals. Critically endangered, the sea turtle is at risk
      from many factors, including habitat destruction, entanglement in fishing gear, hunting and egg
      collection, climate change and pollution.
