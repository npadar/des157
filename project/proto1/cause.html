      Sea turtles continue to be harvested unsustainably both for human consumption and trade of their
      parts. Turtle meat and eggs are a source of food and income for many people around the world.
      Some also kill turtles for medicine and religious ceremonies. Tens of thousands of sea turtles
      are lost this way every year, devastating populations of already endangered greens and hawksbills.
      <br />
      Killing of turtles for both domestic and international markets continues as well. While
      international trade in all sea turtle species and their parts is prohibited under the Convention
      on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), illegal
      trafficking persists.
