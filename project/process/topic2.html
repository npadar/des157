            <h2> Topic: Animal Conservation and The Extinction Crisis </h2>
            <p>
              Around 10,000 species become extinct every day. I want to make an interactive
              map of the world to showcase the Earth's dying species. When the user hovers over
              certain places, an image or video of the endangered animals will appear along
              with a "how to help" speal. I think I can combine my other ideas of sustainable
              shopping and eating into this as they are all interrelated. For example, elephants,
              orangatauns, and zebras are all endangered in the Indonesian jungle due to the
              destruction of their habitats for palm oil plantations. Consumers can help by
              not buying any products that contain palm oil or only buying products from companies
              that have pledged sustainability. It will then show a list of approved companies.
