          <h2> Research on 3 articles </h2>
          <p>
            The first article I read, “Endangered Species and the Stuff We Buy, All Mapped Out”
            by Joanna Klein, New York Times, has a similar interface to my idea for the project.
            The article includes a map of the biodiversity footprint of the United States trade.
            I wanted to implement a similar map and show which animals around the world are endangered,
            why, and how to help. The map would be interactive with different effects to appeal to the
            user and to keep them engaged. The main point of the article’s map is to show that the things
            people buy and consume can have deadly consequences for wildlife. It visualizes the link between
            global trade to the environmental impact. To help reduce impact, consumers can demand companies
            to join the action by producing sustainable goods with clear labeling. The map doesn’t track the
            density of threats to any specific species, as stated in the article but I plan on implementing
            that into my project.

            Another article I found interesting was, “20,000 Species are Near Extinction: Is it Time to
            Rethink How We Decide Which to Save”, by Christine Dell’Amore from National Geographic.
            This article discusses conservationist's moral dilemma on when it comes time to “save” a
            species, which one do they pick. To save a species, scientists take the remaining individuals
            into captivity and breed them. This costs millions of dollars which is why picking the next one
            is a tricky decision. Much of their decision comes from the general population. In some cases,
            scientists use algorithms and models to predict which species will have the highest return on
            investment. That is, if a certain amount of money is spent on saving a species, how many will
            be saved? It was interesting to think about how these efforts are driven by the species’ economic
            value. For example, which species would bring in the most tourism profit. It’s sad to think that
            saving animals is based off which is most popular or the “cutest”, but this is the unfortunate
            reality. Many of the smaller species and “not cute or furry” species are often forgotten yet are
            often times extremely important to the balance of the environment. However, is has been researched
            that many of the “less popular” endangered species benefit from the “celebrity” species because of
            the ecosystem method which involves setting aside species-rich regions instead of just single-species.

             The article by Justin Sablich of the New York Times, “TripAdvisor to Stop Selling Tickets to
             Many Animal Attractions”, talks about how TripAdvisor has stopped selling tickets on their
             website to places that have animal attractions such as riding elephants, swimming with dolphins,
             petting tigers, etc. The actions of this major company can set the precedent for many other
             companies to follow. It is important that a company of this size uses its influence to promote
             change in others as well. (The site reaches 350 million visitors per month) One of the elements
             I wanted to implement in my project was to provide a list of companies that pledge sustainability
             and the ethical treatment of animals. I often find it hard to find reliable information across
             different sources and wanted my website to serve as a hub for all accurate information.

            The Committee of Recently Extinct Organisms has two databases of mammals and fish that have
            gone extinct. The US Wildlife and Fish Service has databases on endangered species in the US.
            The World Wildlife Fund has databases of presence and absence data of species by terrestrial region.
