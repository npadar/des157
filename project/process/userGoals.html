          <h2>
            How will your users understand the content of the project?
          </h2>
          <p>
            I am going to try to implement a start screen where there will be images
            of animals roaming around their habitat and one by one they will each
            slowly fade out. This is meant to represent the vanishing animals on Earth
            due to climate change and human activity. This start screen will help the user
            gain an understanding of what the content of the project is. Then when the interactive
            map appears, the users will know that the map will represent something related
            to wildlife.
          </p>

          <h2>
            How will your users understand the primary objectives?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The users will understand the primary objective by reading the popups that appear
            when they click on a dot. A popup will appear with different tabs including
            information about the species, why they are endangered, and how to help. By reading
            the how to help page, the users will understand that they objective of this
            project is to inform and to encourage the users to take actions against those who
            are harming the environment and animals.
          </p>

          <h2>
            What content and features do your users need, and in what form do they need it?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The users need information on how they can help directly and also maybe a donate
            section. That way they know they can still make a difference even if they can't
            directly go into the field to help. There will be pictures and videos of the issues
            each species is facing so that the user can gain a better understanding of what is happening
            in the world.
          </p>

          <h2>
            How do your users think your interactive projects should work and what are
            their experience levels with the type of media you are creating?
          </h2>
          <p>
            My plan is to create an interactive map exhibit where the user can touch or click
            on a dot and a popup will appear. I think that they users will know to click around
            once they see a map full of dots. I don't think that they users will need a lot of
            experience with this because the map basically acts like a touch screen device.
            I believe that the majority of the target audience would have experience with
            touch screen devices.
