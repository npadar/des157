              <li> Read a lot about the history and news of the organization </li>
              <li> Didn't realize could click on certain elements because there was no hover effect </li>
              <li> Clicked on tabs, which automatically scrolled down to the correct section on the page </li>
              <li> Checked for responsiveness </li>
