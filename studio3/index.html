      <h2>Hawaii: Summer 2013</h2>
      <p>
        I went to Hawaii the summer of 2013, right after graduating from high school.
        My family and I went island hopping for the first time around Maui, Big Island, and
        Oahu.

      <h2>Iceland: Thanksgiving 2014 </h2>
      <p>
        Iceland is by far my favorite place I visited. It was such a unique and fun experience
        watching the northern lights. We also went swimming in the Blue Lagoon, an outdoor hot spring.
        I could feel the snow falling while swimming.

      <h2> The Netherlands: Summer 2006 </h2>
      <p>
        I remember going to this place where the Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium
        shared a border. I was in three countries at once!

      <h2> Italy: Summer 2012 </h2>
      <p>
        My favorite European country is definitely Italy. I remember visiting the
        Leaning Tower of Pisa, the Colosseum, Venice and Florence. I ate lots of
        pizza, pasta, and gelato! I'm currently taking Italian right now so hopefully
        I will be able to use it the next time I visit.

      <h2> Disneyland: Winter 2016 </h2>
      <p>
        My most recent trip was to Disneyland over winter break. It was my first
        time being there with their Christmas theme which was really beautiful. It
        started raining really hard the first night so we had to leave early but other
        than that it was a very fun trip!
